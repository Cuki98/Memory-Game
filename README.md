## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn


The following **additional** features are implemented:
* [x] User can choose the difficulty
* [x] Sound is played when the user makes a wrong choice
* [x] Center-Aligment was implemented
* [x] Interface was redone

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

While creating this project I faced many challenges. One of the biggest impediments I had was the lack of free time to work on the project. Being a full-time student and a full-time worker can be very time consuming and exhausting. In order to overcome this challenge, I had to plan my week ahead, do all my school projects and tasks to be able to have some free time later that week. Another challenge that I faced is my lack of knowledge in web development. Although the project itself didn’t feel difficult, I had to stop every now and then to look for some syntaxis knowledge. To overcome this challenge I decided to watch a tutorial on the basis of Javascript and HTML to get my fundamentals right. This helped me a lot because I was able to same much more time later down the road.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

As I was working on the project a lot of questions about web development came up to my mind. For example, I wanted to add a level counter that would tell the player the level they are currently on. The number of the level would of have to be updated every time the user gets a sequence right and I didn’t know which was the best way to accomplish such task. Also question such as how long a big scale project takes to finish and what are the limitations that webs have as opposed to games or computer applications. At last, but not least, I wonder how could I possibly improve the code to make more modular and manageable. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had more time on this project I would of have spend more time refactoring the project to make it more modular. More specifically the buttons, I would of have created a GameButtonClass that defines what a game button should be. That way I would have been able to create buttons programmatically and be able to give the players choices of how many buttons the want to play with and much more (I’m not sure if this is possible in javacript, but it’s a very common procedure in SwiftUI, Java or OOP in general). I also wanted to spend some more time working on resizing the overall look of the website and display a counter to keep track of the strikes. It also would been nice to experiment with leaderboard and databases in the website.
